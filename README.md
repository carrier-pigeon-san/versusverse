**_The silliest showdown on Reddit._**

Welcome to **Versusverse** — a chaotic, AI-fueled twist on Rock-Paper-Scissors built for Reddit. Compete with strangers using *anything imaginable*, from flaming marshmallows to existential dread. Created for the [World's Largest Hackathon](https://worldslargesthackathon.devpost.com/), under the **Silly Shit** challenge.

## 🎮 What is Versusverse?

Versusverse is a Reddit-native game where users start or join themed face-offs. Players pick from AI-generated choices and let the AI decide the victor. Every match is absurd, unpredictable, and hilarious.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Start a Game**:  
   Create a post and define a theme like _“Things you'd bring to a clown funeral”_ or _“Weapons in a food fight.”_

2. **Join a Game**:  
   Other Redditors join the game by choosing one of three AI-generated items that fit the theme.

3. **Let the AI Decide**:  
   Once all players have submitted their items, the AI adjudicates — creatively and comedically — to determine the winner.
